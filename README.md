# Particle Sequence Merge - ![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Seface-Blocks/particle-sequence-merge?logo=github&logoColor=959da5&labelColor=353c43&color=0091c2&Current&label=Latest%20Release)
Simple program to merge PNG image sequences into a single image for particle creations for Minecraft.

## Merge the files
1. Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/Seface-Blocks/particle-sequence-merge/releases/tag/latest).
2. Execute `Seface's Particle Sequence Merge.exe` file.
3. Place the relative path to a folder with all the images that you want to generate.
   - You can leave the path blank to use the default path `images/`.<br />
     Have in mind that if the directory doesn't exist, the file will not be generated.
4. The result will be generated as `generated_image.png` in the same directory as the executable file.
